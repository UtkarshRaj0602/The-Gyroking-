# The-Gyroking
The gyroking is a fully autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle design especially made for safe and secure vaccine delivery. This UAV design helped me and my team bag a third prize at IIT Bombay, Techfest 2020 for the event named Aero-Vaccine.

The gyroking is an helicopter having an efficiency of a fixed wing and has VTOL(vertical takeoff and landing capability) even at high-altitudes. The specially designed wing pods will be used to carry the vaccine for covid-19. 

Unique Selling Points: 

1. Can take-off and land anywhere.
2. VTOL and STOL capabilities.
3. Very fast and less complicated mechanism of loading and unloading of the payload. 
4. Less maintaince cost.
5. More fuel efficient and most importanly it can be easily manufactured with current technology. 


Features of the aircraft:

1. Has straight wings. This gives more stiffness and also lighter the weight. 
2. Has a wing tip device at the end plate. 
3. Has a wing pod which be used to carry the payload. 
4. Contains H-tail and rotor blades. 


Challenges covered: 

1. Lifiting the payload of vaccine cylinders (~1-ton). As the paylaod to be lifted weighs about a ton, thus we increased the size of the UAV, lift capacity and the thrust capacity by introducing nasa/langley ls(1)-0413 airfoil and also by using PT6A-135A turbo prop engine, which increased the overall lift and thrust capacity of the UAV. 
2.  Can land in small flat areas. As the UAV has VTOL enabled in it, thus it can easily launch and land vertically without requiring much of a space.
3.  Should be fully autonomous. We used pixhawk PX4 32Bit Flight Controller flight for programming the UAV to be autonomous.

Tools used for this project:

1. XFLR5 - For UAV designing. 
2. Solidworks for full designing and rendering process. 
3. Ansys for simulations and CFDS. 
4. Atmel ATmega - 328P microcontroller for the overall processing and functioning of the UAV.
5. Pixhawk PX4 autopilot flight controller for controlling the UAV. 
6. GPS for real time navigation and tracking of the UAV.


Learning Outcomes: 

1. Learned about flight and UAV desinging. Also, learned desinging using XFLR5. 
2. Learned about pixhawk flight controller, it's uses and its various functioning. 
3. Dived further into microcontrollers, their fucntioning and their programming.
4. Hands-on experience with solidworks and its various properties like surfacing, airfoil designing, etc. 
5. Hands-on experience with ansys and its properties like fluent flow, etc.
